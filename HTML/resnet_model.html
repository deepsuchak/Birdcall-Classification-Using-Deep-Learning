  <h1>What is ResNet-50?</h1>
      <p>ResNet-50 is a CNN architecture that belongs to the ResNet (Residual Networks) family, a series of models designed to address the challenges associated with training deep neural networks. Developed by researchers at Microsoft Research Asia, ResNet-50 is renowned for its depth and efficiency in image classification tasks. ResNet architectures come in various depths, such as ResNet-18, ResNet-32, and so forth, with ResNet-50 being a mid-sized variant.</p>
      <p style="color: red;">ResNet-50 was released in 2015, but remains a notable model in the history of image classification.</p>
  <h1>ResNet-50 in Practice</h2>
    <h2>Workflow/Pipeline Overview</h2>
    <p>The high-level solution for birdcall identification using ModifiedResNet50 involves a systematic workflow consisting of data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation phases.</p>

    <h3>1. Data Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>The process begins with data collection and preprocessing. Various avian vocalization recordings are gathered from the "Cornell Birdcall Identification" dataset. These audio files are then converted into Mel spectrogram images using the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Audio Loading: Audio files are loaded using <code>librosa</code>.</li>
        <li>Mel Spectrogram Computation: Spectrograms are computed using <code>librosa.feature.melspectrogram()</code>.</li>
        <li>Power to dB Conversion: Power spectrogram values are converted to decibel (dB) scale using <code>librosa.power_to_db()</code>.</li>
        <li>Normalization: Mel spectrogram values are normalized between 0 and 1.</li>
        <li>Resizing: Mel spectrograms are resized to the target shape (224, 224).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Model Development</h3>
    <p>The core of the solution is the ModifiedResNet50 model, a variant of ResNet50. ModifiedResNet50 comprises the following components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ResNet50 Layers: Pretrained ResNet50 layers serve as the backbone for feature extraction.</li>
        <li>Fully Connected Layers: The last fully connected layer is modified to include additional dense layers, ReLU activation, and dropout to adapt the model for birdcall identification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Training</h3>
    <p>The model is trained using the preprocessed Mel spectrogram images. During training, the crossentropy loss function is minimized. Training is an iterative process, and hyperparameters such as learning rates and batch sizes are fine-tuned to optimize the model's performance. The trained model is capable of identifying various bird species based on their unique vocalizations.</p>

    <h3>4. Evaluation</h3>
    <p>In the evaluation phase, the trained ModifiedResNet50 model is assessed using real-world birdcall data across the 5-fold cross-validation folds. The model's performance is measured using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC), along with the confusion matrix analysis.</p>

    <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We use a Python-based implementation with PyTorch as the deep learning framework.</li>
        <li>ModifiedResNet50 model architecture is based on ResNet50 with modifications to the fully connected layer.</li>
        <li>Training data includes preprocessed Mel spectrogram images derived from the "Cornell Birdcall Identification" dataset.</li>
        <li>We employ transfer learning to fine-tune the model using the pretrained ResNet50 layers.</li>
        <li>Data augmentation techniques may be used to enhance model robustness during training.</li>
    </ul>
